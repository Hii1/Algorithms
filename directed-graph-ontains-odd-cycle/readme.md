Devise an algorithm that takes an nxn adjacency matrix of a directed graph as input, and
determines whether the directed graph contains a simple cycle of odd length or not. The
running time of your algorithm should be O(n+m) where n is the number of vertices and m
is the number of edges contained in the graph. Also, all the inputs given to the algorithm are
assumed to be legitimate, i.e. the users are assumed to provide only nxn matrices that
consist of only 0s and 1s as inputs.
